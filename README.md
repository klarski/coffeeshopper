## Full Sail University Final Project

Coffeeshopper is a project I created for my final project for my degree. The website was created to be a crowdsourced place for information on coffeeshops around your city. Visitors can create accounts and add new coffeeshops, update information on exisiting coffeeshops, and rate their experence visiting these shops.

The project used all of the skills I learned in school: HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP, and mySQL. I was solely responsible for the planning and execution of the site.
